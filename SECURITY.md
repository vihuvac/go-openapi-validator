## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues are taken seriously in Go OpenAPI Validator. If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please report it **privately** using GitHub's built-in **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/vihuvac/go-openapi-validator/security) of this repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the form with a clear description, affected versions, steps to reproduce, and any suggested fix.

**What to expect**:

- You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**.
- We aim to provide a detailed response within **7 days**.
- If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix, release it in the next patch version (e.g., 1.0.3 or 1.0.4), and credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
